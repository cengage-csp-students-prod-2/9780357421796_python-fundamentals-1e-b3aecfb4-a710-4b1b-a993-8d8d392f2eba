# Scenario

Given a Tuple, find out the number of times a string occurs.

# Aim

Write a script that uses tuple methods to count the number of elements in a tuple and the number of times a particular element appears in the tuple. Based on these counts, the script will also print a message to the terminal.

# Steps for Completion

1. Initialize a tuple, as shown in _Snippet 5.37_:

```python
cars = ('coupe', 'coupe', 'coupe', 'carbiolet', 'sedan')
```

<sup>_Snippet 5.37_</sup>

2. Use a tuple method to count the number of times the `coupe` element appears in the tuple `cars`, and assign it to a variable, `fav`.

3. Use a tuple method to calculate the length of the tuple `cars`, and assign it to a variable, `amt`.

4. If the number of times the `coupe` element appears in the tuple `cars` is more than 45%, print `Too many coupes in the garage.` to the terminal. If not, print `You are all set with cars.` to the terminal.
