# Scenario

Given the following challenges, use `append()`, `extend()`, `pop()`, and `insert()`to change the contents of the lists.

# Aim

The aim of this activity is to get acquainted with list methods by utilizing various Python list methods.

Using the `ipython3` interactive shell, change the contents of this list using the various available methods.

# Steps for Completion

Suppose that we have the following list:

`Strawberry`, `Blueberry`, `Blackberry`, `Cranberry`

Define the list `berries` with the following elements shown in _Snippet 5.11_:

```
   Strawberry, Blueberry, Blackberry, Cranberry
```

<sup>_Snippet 5.11_</sup>

Change the contents of this list using the various available methods:

> Note: Check your output by calling the list after each method

1. Using the built-in `append()` method, add the value `Raspberry` to the list `berries`.

2. Using the built-in `extend()` method, extend an empty `fruits` list from the `berries` list that you created previously.

3. Insert `Mangoes` into the `fruits` list at index `2` using the built-in method `insert()`.

4. Remove the element at index `1` from the `fruits` list using the built-in method `pop()` and replace it with `Apples`, using the `insert()` built-in method.

5. Finally, sort the elements in the `fruits` list by using the built-in method `sort()` with keyword arguments. Set the `key` argument to **None** and the `reverse` argument to **False**.
