# Checking whether a Player has Won

Your task is to complete the function stub `check_cards(player)`. The function takes a player’s hand as input and returns ‘WIN’ if the input player has exactly a count of 21. If they have a count that is greater than 21, then it returns ‘BUST’; otherwise, it returns ‘OK’.
