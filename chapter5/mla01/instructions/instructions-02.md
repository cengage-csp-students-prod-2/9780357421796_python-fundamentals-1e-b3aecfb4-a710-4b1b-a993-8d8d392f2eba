# Drawing a Card from a Deck

Your task is to complete the function stub `draw_card(deck)`.
The function takes a deck as the input. The function should randomly select a card from the deck using the random.choice() method and then remove the card from the deck by completing the remove_card_from_the_deck() function. Once this is done, the function needs to return the card that was selected.
