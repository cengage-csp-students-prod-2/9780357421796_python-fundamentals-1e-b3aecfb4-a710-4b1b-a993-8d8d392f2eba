# `HunterKiller` cell class
In this task you need to create a new class called the `HunterKiller` cell class which extends the `Cell` base class. The `HunterKiller` cell class needs to have the symbol **x**. All other properties that are inherited from the `Cell` class are to remain the same for this activity.
Once this is done, create a petri-dish of size **30** and, similar to before, create **10** instances of this `HunterKiller` cell type with randomly allocated positions. Use `activity2_task4()` stub to complete this task.

Once this is done, begin the simulation!
