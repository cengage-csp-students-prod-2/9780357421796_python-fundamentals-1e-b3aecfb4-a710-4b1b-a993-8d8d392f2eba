### Get familiar with the random generation of cells
Similar to your previous tasks, create a new petri-dish of size 30.  Use `activity1_task3()` stub to complete this task.

Then, using the `random.choice()` method (hint: and the available positions), create and add **10** cells to the petri-dish.

Once this is done, begin the simulation.
