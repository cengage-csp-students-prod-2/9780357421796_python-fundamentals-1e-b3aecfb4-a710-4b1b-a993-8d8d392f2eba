# Adding the `Cells` to the `Petri-dish`

In this final task in this activity you do not need to create any more extended classes. However, you are required to create a `Petri-dish` of size **30**. Then add **10** instances each of `Cell`, `Generic`, `Ecoli`, `Structure`, and `HunterKiller` cells, at randomly allocated positions in the order. That is, create **10** randomly positioned `Cell` types first, then **10** randomly positioned `Generic` types, and so on. Use `activity2_task5()` stub to complete this task.

Once this is done, begin the simulation!
