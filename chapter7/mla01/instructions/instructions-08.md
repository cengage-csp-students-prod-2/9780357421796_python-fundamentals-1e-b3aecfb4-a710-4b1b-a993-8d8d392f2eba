# `Ecoli` cell class
In this task, you need to create a new class called the `Ecoli` cell class, which extends the `Cell` base class. The `Ecoli` cell class needs to have the symbol **e**. All other properties that are inherited from the Cell class are to remain the same for this activity.

Once this is done, create a petri-dish of size **30** and, like before, create **10** instances of this `Ecoli` cell type with randomly allocated positions. Use `activity2_task2()` stub to complete this task.

Once this is done, begin the simulation!
