# `Structure` cell class

In this task, you need to create a new class called the `Structure` cell class, which extends the `Cell` base class. The `Structure` cell class needs to have the symbol **S**. All other properties that are inherited from the `Cell` class are to remain the same for this activity.

Once this is done, create a petri-dish of size **30** and, similar to before, create **10** instances of this `Structure` cell type with randomly allocated positions. Use `activity2_task3()` stub to complete this task.

Once this is done, begin the simulation!
