# Reduce count
For each class that you have created, create a static method called `reduce_count()`. The purpose of this method is to reduce the count for that class by **1**.  Once this is done, create a petri-dish of size **30**. 
Randomly add **10** `Generic`, **20** `Ecoli`, and **30** `HunterKiller` cells to the petri-dish. The order of creation is not important. 

Call the `reduce_count()` method on the `Generic` class **5** times and the `Ecoli` class **5** times.

When you print the result, you should get a `Cell` count of **50**, **5** `Generic`, **15** `Ecoli`, **0** `Structure`, **30** `HunterKiller`.
Use `activity3_task3()` stub to complete this task.
