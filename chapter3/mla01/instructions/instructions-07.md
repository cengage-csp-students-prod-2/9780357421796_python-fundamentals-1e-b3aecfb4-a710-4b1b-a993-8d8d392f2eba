## Make it your own

Add functionality that will that use the current expenses and sales volume but vary the sale price until the "break-even" point is found. If the initial calculation is positive then reduce the price iteratively and if negative, increase the price iteratively (think loop). Note: Your algorithm doesn't have to find the exact break-even point, only the point where it changes from negative to positive or positive to negative. This is the price where the shop “breaks even”:

```
10. Find Break-Even

Enter Selection (0 to Exit): 10
Break-Even occurs with a selling price of: 5.7
```
