# Aim
Using a `for` loop and a `range` function, you have been asked to find the even numbers between **5** and **55** and then find their sum.

# Steps for Completion

1. Define a counter for the sum named `total_sum`.

2. Define a `for` loop with an even range for numbers between **5** and **55**.

3. Add each looped number to the sum.

4. Outside the loop, print out `total_sum`.

The output should be as shown in *Snippet 3.50*:

```python
750
```
