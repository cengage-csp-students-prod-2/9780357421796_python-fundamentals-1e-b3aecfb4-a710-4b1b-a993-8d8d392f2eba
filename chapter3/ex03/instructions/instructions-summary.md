# Aim
The aim of this activity is to create a password authentication feature using a `while` loop.

You have been asked to add a simple password authentication feature for a prototype that your team is setting up. One of your team members has advised the use of a `while` loop.

# Steps for Completion

1. Create a script called *main.py*.

2. Define **input("Enter your name: ")** as the name, **Pas$Word** as the password, and the Boolean variable first.

3. Initiate the `while` loop and for the password ask for the user's input.

4. Validate the password. If the password is correct, print "**Welcome back, name**". If the validation fails return an error and print the message "**Incorrect password, try again...**".

5. Run the script in the terminal using the command *python3 main.py*. 

The output should be as shown in *Snippet 3.32*:

```bash
python3 main.py
Enter your name: Josh
Enter your password: Pas$Word
Welcome back, Josh

python3 main.py
Enter your name: Josh
Enter your password: none
Incorrect password, try again...
Enter your password:
```
