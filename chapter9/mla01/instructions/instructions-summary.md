TargetCRM is CRM software company that sends emails to users every week. The system has a mailing list of users that are active and able to receive emails as well as users that have been unsubscribed. Users that opt out are removed from the database and the remaining users are considered active and keep receiving emails.

A recurrent issue that TargetCRM has is with computing statistics to analyze the actual state of the mailing list. Because of incorrect user input, there are a lot of email addresses in the mailing list in the wrong format, which is undesirable for the company.

The CTO (Chief Technology Officer) of the company wanted to generate a report to check the quality of the email address data. However, when they aggregated the data to create the report, they noticed that the data quality was not good. As more people started using the application, more erroneous email address entries were found. As the system uses email to contact the end users, that was found to be a critical issue.

Take into account that each user with an incorrectly formatted email address in our mailing list is a final customer to whom we cannot send notifications because their email is unreachable. Knowing this, for this project, TargetCRM wants to filter out these users in order to free up storage space for valid users and, in the future, work toward a way to improve overall data quality.

Your solution will allow TargetCRM to save a considerable amount of money from its monthly budget, because your program will free up a team in the company from doing manual checks every week to filter out incorrectly formatted email address data. Manually checking for errors is a very tedious and repetitive task that is costly and prone to failure, which is why automating this process is crucial for the company.

After finishing this project, your solution will be integrated into the mailing list updater application, and the TargetCRM platform will be updated into a newer version with this functionality.
