# Create `is_email_valid_extended()`

Now your code is able to validate whether an email address has the right format to pass the validation. However, every time an incorrect email exists in the list, your code will crash and return an error message informing the user about what happened. In order to make your implementation more user-friendly and responsive, create a function called `is_email_valid_extended()` to catch the exception, print a message to the user, and prevent the code from crashing.
