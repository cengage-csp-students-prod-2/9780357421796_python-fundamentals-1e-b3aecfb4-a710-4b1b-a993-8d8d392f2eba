# Create `is_email_valid()`

Create a function called `is_email_valid()` that is going to be responsible for checking whether an email address is valid or not. This function will receive the updated mailing_list, and for each email, you will check whether the address contains an **@** symbol. If the email does not contain the symbol, your code should raise your custom-defined exception.
