# Create `EmailNotValidError()`
Create a user-defined exception called `EmailNotValidError()` that will be thrown when an invalid email is found. This exception must extend a base exception class to work. Your exception will also accept a message that will be passed by the other functions. This message helps programmers to understand what sort of error happened while debugging the code.
