As a developer, you may need to create exception classes that handle custom exceptions that are not defined in the standard library in a certain way. In this challenge, we will practice creating custom exception classes.

The steps are as follows:

1. Subclass the `Exception` class and create a new `Exception` class of your choosing.

2. Write some code where you use the `tryâ€¦except` flow to capture and handle your custom exception.
