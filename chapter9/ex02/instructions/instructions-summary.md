# Scenario

You are testing code to determine types of errors. During programming, errors often occur. But how can we anticipate when something will cause an error? You can anticipate errors by thoroughly understanding error scenarios and causes.

# Aim

In this activity, we will create error scenarios. Letâ€™s write some code that will cause a `KeyError` and an `AttributeError`.

# Steps for Completion

1. Go to your _main.py_ file.

2. Define a function `createError` to first generate a `KeyError` and then an `AttributeError`.

> In order to generate both errors, you will need to generate only one error at a time.
