# Scenario

You have been given three code snippets that need to be completed in order to execute.

# Aim

In each of the code snippets replace the `?` character with the correct Boolean operator, for instance `<`,`>`,`==`,`not`, or `not in`. Each code block should execute correctly.

> After you have executed a code snippet, run the corresponding task to ensure you have passed before moving on to the next snippet.

# Steps for Completion

1. Consider the following code in _Snippet 2.82_:

```python
num = 61
if num % 2 ? 0:
	print("Odd")
```

<sup>_Snippet 2.82_</sup>

2. Consider the following code in _Snippet 2.83_:

```python
days = 32
if days ? 31:
	print("Not a valid day of the month.")
```

<sup>_Snippet 2.83_</sup>

3. Consider the following code in _Snippet 2.84_:

```python
character = "c"
if character ? ["a", "i"]:
    print(f"The letter '{character}' does not also constitute a word.")
```
