Note: Adding packages to your Python project
Python has a wealth of built-in functionality; however, as with most languages, there comes a time to put more “tools in the toolbox”. This is done by importing packages into Python using the `import` keyword. However, what if your computer doesn’t have a particular package installed? The answer is `pip` which is Python’s utility for installing packages and is bundled with Python for versions 3.4 and later. There are a number of things that `pip` can do but the most common uses are installing a package, uninstalling a package, and listing the installed packages.

This is done from the command line as follows:

• Install a Package: `pip install <somePackage>` (Example: `pip install requests`).

• Uninstall a Package: `pip uninstall <somePackage>` (Example: `pip uninstall requests`).

• List installed packages: `pip list`.
