# Aim

Check the types of different values.

# Steps for Completion

1. Open the Python interactive shell and enter the code shown in _Snippet 1.13_ to view the type of the numeric value `7`. Observe the output:

```
>>> type(7)
<class 'int'>
>>>
```

<sup>_Snippet 1.13_</sup>

As you can see, it tells us that the type of 7 is `int` (short for integer).

2. Now, enter the code shown in _Snippet 1.14_, and observe the output:

```
>>> type(4+3)
<class 'int'>
>>>
```

<sup>Snippet 1.14</sup>

3. Enter the code in _Snippet 1.15_ in the prompt, and observe the output:

```
>>> type("7")
<class 'str'>
>>>
```

<sup>_Snippet 1.15_</sup>

4. Enter `type('7')` as shown in _Snippet 1.16_ and observe the output:

```
>>> type('7')
<class 'str'>
>>>
```

<sup>_Snippet 1.16_</sup>

> The part in the output before `int` says `class` because everything in Python is an **object**.
