# Aim

Work with the Python interpreter.

# Steps for Completion:

1. At the command prompt type in the command `python3` and press **Enter**, next enter the command shown in _Snippet 1.1_. to run the popular "Hello World!" program.

```
>>> print("Hello World!")
Hello World!
>>>
```

<sup>Snippet 1.1</sup>

Calling `print` logs the passed message to the standard output.

2. Anything you type into the shell is echoed back. Type **"Echo"** in the shell to check this as shown in _Snippet 1.2_:

```
>>> "Echo"
'Echo'
>>> 1234
1234
>>>
```

<sup>Snippet 1.2</sup>

3. You can even do some calculations (note that the order of operations is observed). Carry out a few mathematical operations in the terminal, like those shown in _Snippet 1.3_:

```
>>> 9 + 3
12
>>> 4 * 5
20
>>> -6 + 5 * 3
9
>>>
```

4. Finally, exit the shell by running the **exit()** command as shown in _Snippet 1.4_:

```
>>> exit()
```
