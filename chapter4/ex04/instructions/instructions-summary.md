# Scenario

You need a quick way to work out exponential values given one base number and a second number. 

# Aim

Write a lambda function that takes in two numerical values and returns the first value, raised to the power of the second value:

# Steps for Completion

1. Create a lambda function that takes in `number` and `power` and returns the value of the number raised to power.

2. Assign it to a variable called **exponential**.

3. Print the `exponential` variable.

Using the numberical values 2 and 6, the output should be as shown in *Snippet 4.42*:

```python
64
