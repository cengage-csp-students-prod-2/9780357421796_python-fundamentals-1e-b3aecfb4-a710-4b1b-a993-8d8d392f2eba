# Create a python module

Create a python module to encapsulate the functions that you created to read, process and persist the mailing list into a new file:

```python
import mailinglist_validation_util from mailinglist_util as mlu
```

With the import above, we should be able to call any of the other functions (`read_mailing_list_file`, `save_output_file`, `mailinglist_validation_util`) from the mlu object. You will be required to do this in the next task.
