# Scenario
You are implementing a program at work and you need to use a package that you have never interacted with before. You find that you need to write a script using the directory method to list all resources that are available in that package.

# Aim
Use a function which will take a package or module name and print out the names of all the resources defined in the package or module using the directory method.

# Steps for Completion
1. Define a function called `resources_scanner` that takes an argument `package`.
2. Using the `dir` method create a variable to list all the resources that are available in that package.
3. Inside the function, use a `for` statement to print and list each of the packageâ€™s resources.

Run your script using the *python3 main.py* command in the terminal or by importing and calling your method in the interactive python shell. The output should be as shown in *Snippet 8.37*:

```python
>>> resources_scanner(string)
