#  Complete the `calculate_path_to_goal()` function
The final task is to complete the `calculate_path_to_goal()` function. The aim of this function is to list all the objects of interest and their coordinates that are closer to the spaceship than the goal. The objects of interest include fuel, which is marked with **‘F’**, and treasure, which is marked with **‘T’**. The input into this function is the list of objects encountered, which was determined in task 7. The output of the function is a list, which is sorted by the distance value in ascending order, of objects that are represented as tuples in the form of (distance, coordinates, symbol).

Analyze two exploration missions.

The `run_exploration()` function has been set up in such a way that two exploration missions are executed. Now we can focus on the similarities and differences between the missions.
