# Best Practices to Follow:

- Write detailed comments where necessary.

- Organize and structure code for readability.

- Write your own test cases in order to check for correctness.

# Complete the `generate_available_coordinates(map_size)`

Complete the `generate_available_coordinates(map_size)` function in order to generate and return a list of all possible coordinates in the grid, remembering that each coordinate is a tuple of the form of (x,y). The function takes the size of the map.
